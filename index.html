            <h2>My Top Three Personal Values</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Authenticity</h3>
                <p>I strive to be myself without letting anyone's opinion get to me.</p>
                <p>I think that being yourself at all times is super important. A new place like college might make someone want to hide their personality and follow the trends, but you need to embrace yourself. No one can be you better than yourself. </p>
                <p>I am a person who is very individualistic. I know what I like and what I don't. My parents taught me that the right people will find you if you embrace yourself first. I love myself, and I shouldn't have to change for anyone. </p>
                <p>If you aren't Authenticity, then you will feel more insecure. People might see you as weak-willed or a copycat.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Open-mindedness</h3>
                <p>I believe in valuing everyone's point of view in life. Being open to everything is vital to me. </p>
                <p>My top personal value is openness. Being open to everything is how we learn about everything. It's how you grow as a person. Gaining new perspectives is vital to the human experience.  </p>
                <p>I was taught from a young age to take everyone into consideration. This turned into gaining new values from talking to a variety of people.</p>
                <p>If you aren't an open-minded person then you will be unable to grow as a person. You will be unreceptive to other ideas which will hinder you as a person. </p>
            </div>
             <div>
                <h3>Patience</h3>
                <p>I strive to wait stuff out with getting upset. Sometimes in life you have to wait and that is okay.</p>
                <p>Patience is about self-control. I tried to not let things that I can't influence get to me. It's important to me as it helps to control your emotions. Practing strong patience is key to surviving the stressful adult world. </p>
                <p>I used to let every little thing that bugged me control my life. I'd get so annoyed and this would carry over to my emotions. My emotions would erupt due to this stress. But by learning how to properly interpet the situation I am in and how I should react, my ability to deal with stress has improved.</p>
                <p>Without patience, you will make impulsive decisions which can damage relationship and your mental health.  </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Kindness</h3>
                <p>I value genuine acts of care and consideration that comes from a place of love.</p>
                <p>Kindness means a lot to me. I love to go out of my way to be kind to others. And when others are kind to me, it reminds me the value in life. </p>
                <p>Growing up, my family valued being kind. I can remember many situations where my parents went out of their way to do something just for me. It instilled that value in me that I care wherever I go. </p>
                <p>Being unkind leads to people having a negative view of you. You are likely to not take others into consideration. You might be seen as angry and unwilling to work with others.</p>
